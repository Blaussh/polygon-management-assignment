## 🎯 Key Points to Highlight

### Technical Implementation:

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + SQLite + Prisma
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Interactive canvas, adaptive text sizing, keyboard shortcuts
- **Testing**: Jest (backend) + Vitest (frontend) with comprehensive coverage
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, production-ready configuration

### Assignment Requirements Met:

- ✅ All API endpoints with exact JSON format specified
- ✅ 5-second delays on all API operations
- ✅ Canvas background from specified URL
- ✅ Interactive polygon drawing and management
- ✅ Persistent storage across server restarts
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (optional requirement)
- ✅ Docker containerization (optional requirement)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting for Reviewers

If the reviewer encounters issues:

1. **Docker not starting**: Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 3000/5000 are available
3. **Database issues**: Database is created automatically on first run
4. **API delays**: All endpoints have 5-second delays as requested

Quick fix commands:

```bash
# Reset everything
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```
